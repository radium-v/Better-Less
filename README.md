# Better-Less
Cross-compatible syntax highlighting for Less

## Project Mission
 * Works with Atom, Sublime Text, and Textmate 2.
 * Aligns with current CSS features without being overbearing or too relaxed

## Installation

### Atom
Install `better-less` from Atom's Package Manager or the command-line equivalent:

```
$ apm install better-less
```

You may need to disable the `language-less` core package.

### Sublime Text
Use `Package Control` and install `Better Less`. Alternatively, you can clone this project and put it in your Sublime Text packages directory.

### TextMate 2
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Contributing
For the time being, I'm making changes using [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev) to convert the `YAML-tmLanguage` to `tmLanguage`, with some extra messy steps involved when converting it for Atom (using [CSON Converter](https://github.com/idleberg/sublime-cson-converter). Any help, bugs, and suggestions are welcome!
